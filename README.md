<h2>Care Inspectorate trackers</h2>
Respository holds all the code for cleaning and processing monthly data from the Care Inspectorate. 
Source data is taken from the Care Inspectorate datastore which is updated monthly. 
Our trackers focus on the performance and number of services across care homes and childcare services including day care of children and child minding. 
The resulting analysis includes monthly details on total servies registered, average grade performance on local authority levels, etc.
